- Create a Blockchain

  - What will we learn:

    - Transactions and UTXOs
    - Where do transaction fees come from?
    - How wallets work
    - Signatures: Private and Public Keys
    - What is Segregated Witness? (SegWit)
    - Hierarchically Deterministic (HD) Wallets

  - Transactions and UTXOs

    - All transactions sent to you are called UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs)
    - In any cryptocurrency there is nothing like a Wallet. A central place where all your accumulated money is kept

    - There cannot be any unspent Bitcoin in your wallet. You need to spend it all e.g. in the above case, I sent 0.5 BTC to the bike shop and the remaining amount from 0.6 BTC back to myself

  - Where do transaction fees come from?

    - Anything you do not account for, becomes the transaction fee
    - Every transaction should have a fee in order for the transaction to be picked up by miners. If the transaction is not picked up within 72 hours, it is rolled back

  - How wallets work?

    - Blockchain does not have any balance or wallet, yet your trader provides you with one
    - The wallet calculates the total UTXOs that are available to you and calls it as the balance

  - Signatures: Private and Public Keys

    - Everyone has their own private keys
    - Private key is used to sign a message
    - They together from a signature
    - A private key can always generate a public key but a public key cannot never generate (determine) a private key
    - A verification function determines whether the message and signature is authentic or not

  - What is a Segregated Witness? (SegWit)

    - Bitcoin has a limit of 1mb per block
    - How to improve bandwidth in a network?
      - Hard fork - increasing the block size - resulted in Bitcoin Cash
      - Soft fork - SegWit
    - An upgrade for how Blockchain works
    - It looks it contents of a particular transaction
    - We also need to attach the signature and the public key to the transaction
    - We need people to be able to verify the authenticity of the transaction
    - Signature and Public Key end up taking 60% of the transaction

    - The idea is to remove the Signature and Public Key and send it individually through Bitcoin's own messaging service, hence saving up some space
    - This allowed more transactions to be included as a single transaction now took less space
    - Litecoin also uses SegWit

  - Public Key vs Bitcoin address:
    - Bitcoin address is generated by applying SHA-256 algorithm to the public key
    - You do not expose your public key everywhere. The reason being that if somehow someone is able to reverse engineer your private key with the public key, they would be able to steal all your money.
    - Hence, you provide them with your address
  - Hierarchically Deterministic Wallets

    - As your public key and a address are both present on the blockchain, people could easily pick it up and know how much money do you have
    - In BIP-32 update, a Master Private key was introduced. It helps generate another private key which is then used to sign data to create signatures

    - They also have a master public key, can be used to recreate any public key and addresses. It can be provided to some kind of auditor who does not need to need money
